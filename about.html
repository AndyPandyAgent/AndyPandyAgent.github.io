                Hi, I am Andie Larsson! I am a Technical/Gameplay Designer at Future Games Stockholm.
                My love for game development originates from a specific memory. I was about 12 or 13 years old, playing “the Hunter” with my cousin.
                I remember us having so much fun, we both dreamed of being hunters so we really got sucked into the game.
                I looked over at my cousin and saw the biggest smile I've ever seen on him.
                That's when I said to him: “I'm going to make the best game you've ever played”.
                He of course just looked at me and said something like “sure buddy” but I was dead serious.
                As soon as I got home I begged my dad to get me a Scratch intro book, and he did. I made my first little game at 13 and never looked back.
