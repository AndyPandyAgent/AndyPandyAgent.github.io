            <h3>Narrative Design</h3>
            <p>12 pages of dialouge with a choice tree</p>

            <h2>Narravtive Design</h2>
            <p>
                The narrative design process consisted of a creative decision making process between me and the artist. <br />
                The artist had all these ideas behind the characters they were making and I wanted to show these characters the best way possible in the story. <br />
                It was a lot about asking them how they thought they would react, what feelings they would feel and how they spoke. <br />
                The rest was just me writing and coming up with situations and choices for the player.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Choice tree</h3>
            <p>
                The choice tree was made to clearly visualize and clarify as a designer how everything looked<br />
                The tree was changed a lot throughout the project due to schedule.<br />
                We were very ambitious but quickly scaled it down to made deadline

            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Project Owner</h2>
            <p>
                This role was all about management and to make our team one.<br />
                Most of the people in this team had never worked with each other before so I tried to make everyone feel welcome and at home every morning and to make sure we got to know each other.<br />
                Management wise I organized and keep track of our Trello board and made sure we got things done on time.
