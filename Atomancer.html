                My role as a gameplay designer consisted of research, ideating and prototyping as well as balancing later on. <br />
                The main idea of the gameplay was that the player always moves and only steers the character.

                <sub>
                    I prototyped the full game on the first day including movement, <br />
                    simple enemies and two abilities to get a feel if the game was fun. <br />
                    This helped the team understand the vision of the game and helped me <br />
                    start prototyping other things without having to wait for programmers.

                    We had a goal to get 5 working abilities in the game before the deadline. <br />
                    The goal of the abilities was to make the player feel powerful <br />
                    and for them to compliment the constant movement. <br />
